# Java-Project-Two
In this program, there are two parts.  
- Part One: contained in the LinkedList class. We are instructed to create a method called reverse() that reverses a linked list using only constant space. 
- Part Two: contained in the CustomQStack and CustomSQueue classes. 
  - CustomQStack: we are instructed to demonstrate that Queues can be modified to act exactly as Stacks. 
  - CustomSQueue: we are instructed to demonstrate that Stacks can be modified to act exactly as Queues. 

# CustomQStack Class - Constructor
The class' constructor has a single Queue object in its constructor.

# CustomQStack Class - Methods
The methods in CustomQStack are those of the Stack class but are implemented using methods from the Queue class.
Thus, the methods included are:
- empty, pop, push

# CustomSQueue Class - Constructor 
The class' constructor has two Stack objects in its constructor.

# CustomSQueue Class - Methods
The methods in CustomSQueue are those of the Queue class but are implemented using methods from the Stack class.
Thus, the methods included are:
- add, poll
